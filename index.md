### Personal Info
Name: Rabeed Khan

Student Number: S3930700

Email: s3930700@student.rmit.edu.au

I was born in Bangladesh and moved to Australia when I was 8 years old. At the time I primarily spoke Bengali but was rather fluent in English too as I had grown up playing games and watching films that were in English. It was a also a requirement at the school I attended to speak English at all times as well so that we could learn the language easier so that definitely helped with the transition as well. I still speak Bengali with family as well as English. So far to date I have completed my high school studies here, graduating from Macquarie Fields High School after transferring, and currently undergoing my tertiary studies. Aside, from that I really enjoy gaming during my spare time, a good single player game can take up hours of my time on a good day. I also love cars as well, and the feeling of driving, something that I can’t quite put into words.

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT sparked primarily from gaming. Growing up playing video games back when I was young and comparing how much the technology and processing power of computers from then to now astonishes me. Especially, graphical fidelity within games, one of the reasons why I love playing single player games is because in those games I can set all graphics settings to the highest possible and see how good the game actually looks since higher framerates are not required in these scenarios. Speaking of frame rates and how the advancement in processing power astonishes me, seeing these new CPUs and GPUs coming out that are able to output the power that they do compared to my gaming PC that had 512mb of RAM then is mind blowing and as such my passion took me deeper into the sector. I would learn things about computers through youtube and read articles. At a point, my family would come to me to resolve their tech issues, and from there they were also an encouragement in going towards studying IT. Choosing to come to RMIT worked out best, as it was the most flexible with time. As a full-time worked, time is a big factor and I was glad I was able to pick this course. I expect this course will have all the necessary content for me to learn to be skilled enough within this industry. 

### Ideal Job
[Software Development Manager | FinTech](https://www.seek.com.au/job/55456065?type=standard#solHash=52efaf362224e6f6294a1e9f253ab7e3c85c94a0)

It is a position at a FinTech Start-up called Just Digital People. They are looking for a development manager that is experienced in .NET, React & Flutter to manage and engineer applications that will run across Android, iOS and the web. The main reason this role attracted me is because it is a start-up. I have always liked the culture of start-ups from hearing anecdotes of friends and colleagues that have worked at start-ups and it always seems up beat and a great place to learn new skills as you are closer to the development cycle of the products I feel. I have also been working in the finance industry on the side and as such have come around the term Fintech quite a lot. This is also an area that I wish to explore and learn more about since I already have experience within the finance industry albeit minimal. 

The role requires the following skills:
-	Front-end in JavaScript/TypeScript - Angular or React.
-	Back-end in .NET Core/C#.
-	HTML5/CSS3/SASS.
-	Mobile development experience - iOS/Android preferably with experience using Flutter.
-	DevOps - AWS or Azure.
-	Microservices Architecture.
-	RESTful Web Services.
-	Test Driven Development.

As well as previous experience within a growing start-up, along with experience within a leadership role. Unfortunately, I don’t have any of these skills currently. My plan to gain these skills however, would be to initially get a role within a growing start-up to gain that experience under my wing, preferably a role requiring 3-4 of the required skills in this role. This will essentially provide me a development path up to more demanding roles which in turn can teach me about the other skills required and once I have everything mastered I would take the opportunity to go for a role like this. Even if it is a case that I do not have everything learnt, I believe it would still be worth a shot to try and learn from the people that require it. 

### Personality Tests
Based off these results, it seems that my personality is somewhat sitting on the fence between being an introvert and an extravert. I tend to be assertive with my behavior and apparently have a hard time agreeing to other views. In my personal opinion, I feel I am rather open minded so I guess that is an area of the test that may be a bit hit or miss in terms of the results. The Big Five test however, did give me a higher score on “Conscientious” so that in a sense does marry the previous comments together. Within a team environment, I know my assertiveness can get in the way, but my openness does assist in keeping efficient within that environment. As a result, when forming a team my primary focus would be to work with someone who is also open minded so that my assertiveness does not take over.
