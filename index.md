## Rabeed's Profile

### Personal Info
Name: Rabeed Khan

Student Number: S3930700

Email: s3930700@student.rmit.edu.au

I was born in Bangladesh and moved to Australia when I was 8 years old. At the time I primarily spoke Bengali but was rather fluent in English too as I had grown up playing games and watching films that were in English. It was a also a requirement at the school I attended to speak English at all times as well so that we could learn the language easier so that definitely helped with the transition as well. I still speak Bengali with family as well as English. So far to date I have completed my high school studies here, graduating from Macquarie Fields High School after transferring, and currently undergoing my tertiary studies. Aside, from that I really enjoy gaming during my spare time, a good single player game can take up hours of my time on a good day. I also love cars as well, and the feeling of driving, something that I can’t quite put into words.
